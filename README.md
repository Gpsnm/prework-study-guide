# Prework Study Guide

## Description

A Web page created for boot camp students during our pre work assignments.
 I was motivated to build this project to get me started in learning front end web development.
 I built this project to be able to refer back to my study notes as and when i need to.
 The problem it solves is the ability to have all of my pre work notes accessible in one place.
 I learnt a lot of new things including HTML CSS Git and Javascript.

## Usage

It's main usage is to be referred back to as and when you need it , each section contains  notes on a different subject
including HTML , CSS , Git and Javascript. If we open the devTools console on any web browser we can see Javascript at work.
the function we created will automatically choose a subject for us to study at random.
